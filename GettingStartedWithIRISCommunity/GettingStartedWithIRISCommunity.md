# Getting Started with IRIS Community

InterSystems IRIS is an advanced data platform, providing SQL and NoSQL database management, server-side application coding and data-analytics in one, trusted, enterprise-grade product. InterSystems IRIS for Health uses InterSystems IRIS at the core, but includes additional healthcare features, including tools for a FHIR server, and built in handling of many healthcare data standards. 

InterSystems IRIS Community and InterSystems IRIS-Health Community are free-to-use versions for experimentation, evaluation and non-commercial explorations of the platform's capabilities. There are certain resource and functionality limitations to prevent these editions being used in a production environment, for example the total data limit is 10 GB and the license key expires 1 year after the version's release. However, these are a great resource to begin exploring how to use InterSystems IRIS.

While this article will focus on using InterSystems IRIS Community Edition, the same is true for InterSystems IRIS for Health Community Edition.

InterSystems IRIS Community can be used in three ways: 
- [Run in a container using Docker](./RunningWithDocker.md)
- [Download an install kit](./UsingInstallKit.md)
- [Run on the cloud](./RunningOnCloud.md)
