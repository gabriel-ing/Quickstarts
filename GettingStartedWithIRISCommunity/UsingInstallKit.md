From here, choose whether you would like InterSystems IRIS Community or InterSystems IRIS For Health Community, then choose your operating system and the version (remember that license files will expire 1 year after release, so its recommended to choose the most recent).

Finally, accept Terms of Service and Privacy Statement, and then select Download to begin downloading the installation kit. 

For more information on the install, see the [platform specific installation guides in the documentation](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=PAGE_deployment_install)
