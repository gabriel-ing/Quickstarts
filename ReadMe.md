# Quickstarts WIP 

Currently have first drafts of:

- [Server-side coding (ObjectScript/Classes/Embedded Python)](ServerSideCoding/Getting%20started%20with%20server-side%20coding.md)
- [External Python](ExternalPython/External%20Python%20Quickstart.md)
- [REST](REST-Quickstart/REST%20Quickstart.md)
- [Setting Up Development environment (VS Code)](DevelopmentEnvironment/Development%20Environment%20Set-up.md)
- [Vector Search](VectorSearch/VectorSearch.md)
- [Creating a FHIR Server ](FHIRServer/CreateAFHIRSeverIn5Minutes.md) 
    - This might benefit from another related page on using the FHIR server

I have WIP pieces on
- [Using SQL](SQL/SQLFromObjectscript.md)
- [IRIS-SQL Essentials](SQL/IRIS-SQL-Basics.md)

Below is the suggested list of quickstarts still to be written: 

- Running IRIS (community?) on docker / on the cloud. This is basically [Derek's article](https://community.intersystems.com/post/how-get-intersystems-iris-community-edition)
- Interoperability productions
- Integrated ML 


To go to contractor: 
- Java
- .NET
- Analytics


As an aside, this is a nice feature of the vector search documentation page:
