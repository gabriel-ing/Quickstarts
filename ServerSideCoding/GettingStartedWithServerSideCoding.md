# Getting Started with Server-Side Code

A major benefit of the InterSystems IRIS, the core data platform behind the other InterSystems products, is its ability to run code in the same location, or on the same server, as the databases. This ability allows operations involving the data to be run directly on the data, without moving or duplicated the information. As a result, InterSystems IRIS is a market leader in speed of processing. As a result, InterSystems IRIS, and the technology built with it,  enables rapid data processes, real-time analytics, faster machine learning and many more great features. 

InterSystems IRIS runs on Object-oriented code within Classes. The functions within the classes are called methods and are written in Embedded languages - ObjectScript and Python. 

This guide is meant to be a one-stop reference guide to IRIS classes and coding with ObjectScript and embedded Python for experienced developers. The guides included in this section are: 
- [Class Programming](./ClassProgramming.md)
- [ObjectScript Basics](./ObjectScriptBasics.md)
- [Globals](./Globals.md)
- [Embedded Python](./EmbeddedPython.md)
- [SQL in ObjectScript](./RunningSQLFromObjectScript.md)
